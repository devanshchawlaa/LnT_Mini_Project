During the past several decades personnel function has been transformed from a relatively obscure record keeping staff to central and top level management function. There are many factors that have influenced this transformation like technological advances, professionalism, and general recognition of human beings as most important resources.
A computer based management system is designed to handle all the primary information required to calculate monthly statements of customer account which include monthly statement of any month. Separate database is maintained to handle all the details required for the correct statement calculation and generation.
This project intends to introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as record updation, maintenance, and searching. The searching of record has been made quite simple as all the details of the customer can be obtained by simply keying in the identification or account number of that customer. Similarly, record maintenance and updation can also be accomplished by using the account number with all the details being automatically generated. These details are also being promptly automatically updated in the master file thus keeping the record absolutely up-to-date.
The entire information has maintained in the database or Files and whoever wants to retrieve canâ€™t retrieve, only authorization user can retrieve the necessary information which can be easily be accessible from the file.
