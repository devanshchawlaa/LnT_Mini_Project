# **SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE**

A system development life cycle is a logical process by which system analysts, software engineers, programmers, and end users build information systems and computer applications to solve business problems and needs.
The major phases involved in the MIS development process are referred to as system development life cycle. Each phase of the development process must have well defined objectives ,and at the end of each phase ,progress towards meeting the objectives must be evaluated.
The development process should not continue until the objectives of all prior phases have been met.
 
System development life cycle is a phased approach to analysis and design to ensure that systems are best developed.
The system development life cycle can be divided into seven phases as shown in fig

## **UML Case Diagram-**

In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a use case diagram can summarize the details of your system's users (also known as actors) and their interactions with the system. To build one, you'll use a set of specialized symbols and connectors.

## **Class Diagram-**

The class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It is used for general conceptual modeling of the structure of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the models into programming code. Class diagrams can also be used for data modeling.

## **State Diagram-**

A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems. State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.
